Presenting 3D data is essential in today's applications. In LabVIEW, the process involves creating an object added to a scene capable of containing multiple textured objects and various lighting effects. This scene is then rendered in a 3D Picture, offering versatile camera controls—spherical, flying, or oriented—to navigate through the environment. The setup resembles OpenGL, likely the underlying renderer.

The 3D Picture also includes basic functionalities like a point picker and limited texturing. Additionally, the palette provides .STL and .VRML loaders, although the specific version of VRML supported isn't specified by NI.

I'm curious about the effectiveness of integrating the 3D scene into LabVIEW and the achievable framerate when sensor data changes. While I plan to explore it in the future, for more complex visualizations, it might be more practical to launch a dedicated viewer via LabVIEW's command line or VIs instead of relying solely on its capabilities.
