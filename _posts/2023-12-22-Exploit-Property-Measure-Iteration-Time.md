It's vital to measure how long your iterations take when optimizing code. To ensure reliable results, consider closing the block diagram and turning off debugging in VI-Properties.
When it comes to implementation, there are two methods. Personally, I opt for using the feedback node as it avoids cluttering the diagram with connected shift registers.
